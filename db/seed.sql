r/leetcode - Meta MLE PhD internship interview
However, most of the problems were done about 2 months ago; I still have rough memory/sense of them, but it would definitely take some time for me to review and get more familiar.

My question now is kind of a typical debate of quality v.s. quantity. More specifically, which path would you suggest for me to better prepare for the interview:

1) First focus on top-k (k being like 50, 100) frequent problems in FB tagged list, get really good at them, and do the following unfinished problems later just as regular practice.

2) Finish the rest problems (254 - 156 = 98) first, and then review previously finished ones and summarize/categorize.

Any advice or suggestions on what I should do is greatly appreciated. General ideas on interview prep would also be super helpful.', 'zzzsteven30', 'leetcode', '2024-01-23 00:31:52');
